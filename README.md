Aim

To implement a live character counter that updates as users type in a text area.

Objectives

Create a responsive text input component

Implement real time character counting

Add visual feedback for character limits

Style the interface using modern CSS

Description

This experiment demonstrates how to track user input in real time using JavaScript event listeners. As the user types into the textarea, the character count updates instantly. When the defined character limit is reached, visual feedback is provided by changing the border color and displaying a warning message.

Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

Features

Live character count

Character limit enforcement

Visual warning when limit is reached

Responsive layout

Hardware / Software Requirements

Hardware

i3 or higher CPU

Minimum 4 GB RAM

Software

VS Code or any text editor

Chrome / Firefox browser

Experiment 2: Interactive SVG Drawing Tool
Aim

To build an interactive SVG drawing tool with mouse event handlers.

Objectives

Create an SVG canvas component

Implement mouse event tracking

Add shape drawing functionality

Include color selection and undo feature

Make the canvas responsive using viewport units

Description

This experiment focuses on interactive graphics using SVG. Users can draw shapes such as lines, rectangles, and circles directly on the SVG canvas using mouse actions. The tool also allows color selection and supports undoing the last drawn shape. The canvas scales automatically with the viewport, ensuring responsiveness.

Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

SVG

Features

SVG based drawing canvas

Mouse based drawing interaction

Shape selection (Line, Rectangle, Circle)

Color picker support

Undo functionality

Responsive design using vw and vh units

Hardware / Software Requirements

Hardware

i5 CPU or higher

Minimum 8 GB RAM

Software

Chrome or Firefox browser

SVG compatible environment

How to Run the Experiments

Download or clone the project files

Open the HTML file of the required experiment

Run it directly in any modern web browser

No additional setup or libraries are required

Conclusion

These experiments demonstrate the basics of interactive UI development using web standards. They help in understanding event handling, real time updates, SVG graphics, and responsive design, which are essential concepts in modern front end development.
Experiment Title

Dynamic Product Filter with Sorting and Category Selection

Aim

To create a dynamic product filter that sorts and filters items based on dropdown selection.

Objectives

Implement filterable product data

Create a dropdown menu for filtering products

Display products using responsive card layout

Improve user experience with clean UI design

Description

This experiment demonstrates how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to build a dynamic product filtering interface. Products are displayed as cards, and a dropdown menu allows users to filter items based on category. The filtering happens instantly without reloading the page, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.

Features

Dropdown-based product filtering

Card-based product display

Responsive grid layout

Interactive and user-friendly interface

Runs directly in a web browser

Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript

How It Works

Product details are displayed as cards on the page.

Each product card is assigned a category.

When the user selects a category from the dropdown, JavaScript checks the selected value.

Products matching the selected category are displayed, while others are hidden.

Selecting “All Products” shows all available items again.

Hardware / Software Requirements

Any computer with minimum 4 GB RAM

Web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge

Code editor like VS Code (optional)

Output

The output is a responsive product list displayed as cards. Based on the dropdown selection, products are filtered dynamically and updated on the screen without page reload.

Conclusion

This experiment successfully demonstrates dynamic content filtering using JavaScript and DOM manipulation. It helps in understanding event handling, conditional logic, and responsive UI design, which are essential concepts in modern web development.
